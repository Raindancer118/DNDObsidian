## **Amulet of the Shifting Shadows**

>[!INFO] **DESCRIPTION**  
>This amulet is forged from dark silver and inlaid with shimmering gemstones that flicker like distant stars. When worn, it feels alive, pulsating gently with the wearerâ€™s heartbeat.

>[!INFO] **PROPERTIES**  
>- **Misty Step (Limited Use):**  
>  While wearing this amulet, Tharun Darkspine can cast **Misty Step** without expending a spell slot or requiring any material components **three times**. This ability can be used at any time, but after using all three charges, the amulet must be recharged by completing a long rest.
>
>- **Shadow Veil:**  
>  Once per long rest, Tharun can activate the amulet to envelop himself in shadows, granting him advantage on Dexterity saving throws and causing attacks against him to have disadvantage for **1 minute**.

>[!DANGER] **CURSED PROPERTIES**  
>- **Dimming Light:**  
>  While attuned to this amulet, any light-based spells cast by Tharun are treated as if cast at one level lower than their actual level, reducing their effectiveness. Additionally, all allies within a **5-foot radius** of Tharun also suffer this effect, making their light-based spells less potent.

>[!INFO] **ATTUNEMENT**  
>To attune to the Amulet of the Shifting Shadows, Tharun must spend a short rest focusing on its energies while attuning his will to the pursuit of cunning and survival.

>[!INFO] **LORE**  
>Crafted by a long-forgotten sect of warlocks who thrived in the shadows, this amulet is said to connect its bearer with the ever-changing nature of darkness and light, allowing them to evade the grasp of death and deception.
