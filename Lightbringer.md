> **Description:**  
> Lightbringer is a majestic longsword whose blade sparkles in sunlight and emanates a warm, radiant glow in dark environments. The hilt is crafted from the finest dark brown wood, wrapped in silver wire, and the crossguard is shaped like stylized wings, giving the impression that the blade could take flight at any moment.

### **Properties:**

> **Ray of Light:**  
> Once per long rest, the wielder can unleash a ray of light from the sword. This ray has a range of 60 feet and requires an attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage and must make a saving throw against the wielder's spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is blinded for 1 round.

> **Dispelling Darkness:**  
> Lightbringer has the ability to dispel darkness. Each time the sword deals damage, the wielder can choose to trigger a **Dispel Darkness** effect, eliminating any darkness magic within a radius of 20 feet around the hit.

> **Guardian of Light:**  
> The blade cannot be wielded by evil beings. If an evil character attempts to use Lightbringer, the weapon becomes unusable to them, and they take 1d4 radiant damage.

> **Backstory:**  
> Lightbringer was once forged by the powerful mages of Estralith to combat the darkness threatening the kingdom. This weapon was infused with the radiant light of the land that shone from the towers of Estralith. Lightbringer is considered a symbol of resistance and courage, cherished by heroes and warriors who fight for good. Its legendary power is recounted in the stories of the survivors of the fallen kingdom, and the blade remains a coveted artifact for all those who wish to defy the shadows.
